1 check the current IP address in VNC or remote monitor using(ifconfig) command.
172.20.10.7
2.Need to check the gateway ip address for that we have a command called (sudo route -n)
172.20.10.1
3.with the help of current IP address and gateway ip address we can easily sent static ip address
4.for making static use command (sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf)
5.it open up the file then top of it add this lines(interface wlan0 or eth0(which you connected, in next line write static ip_address=<your static ip>), 
next line "static routers Ip adrress(static routers=<Ip address of router>
6.need to assigen DNS we can use google or cloud DNS to assigen that write static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
7. need to reboot now (sudo reboot)

##After the command sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
in file at top you need to add

interface wlan0 or eth0      (make sure how you are connecting with lan or network)
static ip_address=<your choise IP>
static routers=<Ip address of router>
static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4

save the file and reboot (sudo reboot)
